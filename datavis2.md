### **Summary**

For my second data visualization critique, I used a visualization from <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/07/20/protester-demands-police-policy-change-chokehold-ban/5357153002/" target="_blank">USA Today</a> that was focused on protester demands and recent police reform.
