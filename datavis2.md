# Data Visualization Assignment: Critique by Design

### **Summary**

For my second data visualization critique, I used a visualization from <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/07/20/protester-demands-police-policy-change-chokehold-ban/5357153002/" target="_blank">USA Today</a> that was focused on protester demands and recent police reform. Below is a screenshot of this visualization as well as three things that stood out to me as areas that could be improved for impact and understanding.

### **Visualization Areas of Opportunity for Improvement

1. As the first data visualization in this story, the first thing I noticed was that there were four pages to scroll through of the city data. While this table seems to be designed to show the overall impact from protests, by not containing the impact on one page it would be easy for a reader to scroll past or miss the fact that there are many more cities and states hidden.

2. With the places, by listing all of these cities with no spatial relevance it is hard to picture exactly where someplace like Arcata is and if there are any trends to the changes that are happening. By moving this data to a comprehensive map, it would allow someone to more quickly see that reform is centered in certain cities or states.

3. My last initial reaction was in the overall negative space. Because there were nine reforms possible, and most places only implemented one or two (and none implemented all nine yet) it does give the idea that there is a lot to be done - but again, I thought this negative space would be better seen on a map since it could show that entire states or sections of the country have not addressed any of these issues.
