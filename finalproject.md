# Final Project - Part 1

<a href="https://mganska.github.io/ganska-portfolio/">Link to My Main Portfolio Page</a>

For my final project, I wanted to show the impact that local tourism plays on the economy and also provide a meaningful way for people who enjoy travelling to still get out and be tourists responsibly during the pandemic. While I primarily wanted to focus on PA (since I am local to Pittsburgh) and that was my original focus when in the workshop groups, the feedback I got from other students is that this is actually a good story that could be applied around the country and even worldwide. I hadn't necessarily thought of that originally, but taking that step back allowed me to look for some further data sources. Ultimately, at this point my goal is to provide a Shorthand that shows the importance of travel and tourism globally as well as locally and then provide specific details to a Pittsburgh case study. 

As a big picture goal, I also would love to find a way to incorporate user feedback/recommendations. One thing I have really noticed is that certain businesses are taking a proactive and strong approach to social distancing and mask usage, while others are more lax. Allowing the final project to be dynamic with user feedback would also make it more of a one stop resource as opposed to checking multiple sources and recent user feedback regarding businesses adherence to the current standards.

### Outline of my Project

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mganska/ganska-portfolio/master/Final%20Project_Page_3.jpg" width="600"><br>

I am interested in showing the importance of tourism, how COVID-19 has impacted this industry that spans across just the travel segment and into food and beverage, hospitality/hotels, and even into specialty food and beverage production. I then want to highlight how you can still experience tourism and travel at the local level and helpfully impact the region that the user lives in by driving spending locally.

My story arc begins with the positive start that travel is beneficial and has a personal internal benefit along with an external economic benefit. The arc then feeds into the data about COVID-19 and the impact on travel and tourism globally. Lastly, I will highlight some solutions along with cases of local businesses who are operating safely and ethically in the region. Ideally, I will also find a way to allow users to contribute and pin or highlight local experiences that are good experiences during this time of social distancing. My call to action will be for the user to think about their interests and take a moment to see if they can still have valuable experiences locally. For instance, rather than purchasing coffee or food at chain establishments, linking to local businesses that are operating safely and transparently where a user's money will make more impact.

I am going to build this using Shorthand. I am working on finding publically available stock images as well as supplementing with my own local photography when highlighting the Pittsburgh region.

### Data Sources

The UN World Tourism Organization has a lot of interesting data that I am still working through. My expected sources from the UNWTO are:
<a href="https://www.unwto.org/international-tourism-and-covid-19">International Tourism and COVID-19</a><br>
<a href="https://www.unwto.org/unwto-tourism-dashboard">UNWTO Tourism Dashboard</a><br>
<a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/abs/10.5555/unwtotfb0840010020142018201912">UNWTO United States: Country-Specific: Basic Indicators 2014-2018</a> - this data is shown but I did have to purchase the dataset for 7 euro.

I also utilized data from www.visitpa.com. There were comprehensive <a href="https://www.visitpa.com/economic-impact-travel-report">Economic Impact Reports</a> and traveller profiles specific to the state as a whole entity as well as to various PA regions for tourism.

I also found public data on Statista.com.

### Moodboard/Color Palette for Final Project

I created this moodboard on Canva as a way to pull together colors from images that match the feel I'd like to project. These images were mainly pulled as Pennsylvania or Tourism tagged items and highlighted various regional experiences.<br>

### User Research and Interviews

I tried to find users in different age demographics that have some sort of interest in travel and/or tourism.

_Question 1: What do you think this is?_
The majority of my respondents were able to tell that this is a wireframe for a potential website to help people travel locally during COVID-19. 

_Question 2: What is this telling you?_
That you can travel locally if you do some research; that travelling locally is a way to help small businesses.

_Question 3: Is anything surprising or confusing?_
Surprise at the UN data - would have thought more local resources would be used and highlighted.

_Question 4: Is there a specific chart you think can be improved, and how?_
Multiple viewers mentioned the Local Multiplier Effect chart being confusing. I hadn't inserted the actual visualization or sketch of it in this wireframe, but I probably should have.

_Question 5: What would you do differently?_
It would be nice to see a chart showing other industries impacted by tourism.  (ex. food, bev, taxi, manufacturing, farms); more information on local businesses.

From the interviews, I wanted to make sure to add more local references into my final project.

# Final Project - Part 2

The intended audience for my project is really anyone - while I use specific regional examples, I wanted to explain why it is important to think of globally as well. It can be applied to any country, state, or city. I did end up deciding not to use some other more specific PA data to keep it more broad and applicable across the United States; while I had data at the state level, I thought it would wind up being too granular. 

I ultimately decided to use the gold/yellow to represent the travel/tourism as well as to create my title image. I thought it had an overall warm feeling and also would allow it to pop from the other colors in the overall design. I also was able to find a wide range of images to use on Pexel; I'm excited to use this resource in the future since it is so hard to actually find high quality images that are available for use. 

I started trying to make my visualizations in Tableau and felt like I was honestly getting nowhere. Everything was taking longer than I had, so I decided to switch to FLourish and I'm glad that I did. The customization was very simple and since I didn't have a lot of dimensions to plot, it worked better for this project than Tableau would have (at least for me). 

I've embedded my Shorthand below, but if it doesn't work, it can be found <a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/stay-local/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. As a note - I think actually viewing it from the link is best, because it is wider screen and then some of my images maintain their transparency, but I wanted to embed it here too!
