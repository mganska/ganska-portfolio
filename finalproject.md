# Final Project - Part 1

For my final project, I wanted to show the impact that local tourism plays on the economy and also provide a meaningful way for people who enjoy travelling to still get out and be tourists responsibly during the pandemic. While I primarily wanted to focus on PA (since I am local to Pittsburgh) and that was my original focus when in the workshop groups, the feedback I got from other students is that this is actually a good story that could be applied around the country and even worldwide. I hadn't necessarily thought of that originally, but taking that step back allowed me to look for some further data sources. Ultimately, at this point my goal is to provide a Shorthand that shows the importance of travel and tourism globally as well as locally and then provide specific details to a Pittsburgh case study. 

As a big picture goal, I also would love to find a way to incorporate user feedback/recommendations. One thing I have really noticed is that certain businesses are taking a proactive and strong approach to social distancing and mask usage, while others are more lax. Allowing the final project to be dynamic with user feedback would also make it more of a one stop resource as opposed to checking multiple sources and recent user feedback regarding businesses adherence to the current standards.

### Outline of my Project

I am interested in showing the importance of tourism, how COVID-19 has impacted this industry that spans across just the travel segment and into food and beverage, hospitality/hotels, and even into specialty food and beverage production. I then want to highlight how you can still experience tourism and travel at the local level and helpfully impact the region that the user lives in by driving spending locally.

My story arc begins with the positive start that travel is beneficial and has a personal internal benefit along with an external economic benefit. The arc then feeds into the data about COVID-19 and the impact on travel and tourism globally. Lastly, I will highlight some solutions along with cases of local businesses who are operating safely and ethically in the region. Ideally, I will also find a way to allow users to contribute and pin or highlight local experiences that are good experiences during this time of social distancing. My call to action will be for the user to think about their interests and take a moment to see if they can still have valuable experiences locally. For instance, rather than purchasing coffee or food at chain establishments, linking to local businesses that are operating safely and transparently where a user's money will make more impact.

I am going to build this using Shorthand. I am working on finding publically available stock images as well as supplementing with my own local photography when highlighting the Pittsburgh region.

### Data Sources

The UN World Tourism Organization has a lot of interesting data that I am still working through. My expected sources from the UNWTO are:
<a href="https://www.unwto.org/international-tourism-and-covid-19">International Tourism and COVID-19</a><br>
<a href="https://www.unwto.org/unwto-tourism-dashboard">UNWTO Tourism Dashboard</a><br>
<a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/abs/10.5555/unwtotfb0840010020142018201912">UNWTO United States: Country-Specific: Basic Indicators 2014-2018</a> - this data is shown but I did have to purchase the dataset for 7 euro.

I also utilized data from www.visitpa.com. There were comprehensive <a href="https://www.visitpa.com/economic-impact-travel-report">Economic Impact Reports</a> and traveller profiles specific to the state as a whole entity as well as to various PA regions for tourism.

I also found public data on Statista.com.
