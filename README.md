## ganska-portfolio
This is the public portfolio of my work for Telling Stories with Data during the Summer 2020 term.

### About Me
My name is Mary Ganska, my pronouns are she/hers, and I am a part-time MPM student graduating in May 2021. I work at Carnegie Mellon University in the Office of International Education. I have always appreciated clear and clean data along with the way it can relay information so well, and I'm excited to work more with programs I haven't used before. 

I also enjoy photography and recently started a website with some of my work which can be found [here](www.maryganska.com).

### What I Hope to Learn...
I am interested in how to leverage the data from my office to better communicate with our campus partners. I am hopeful that skills I learn in this course can be applied immediately to some projects I'd like to accomplish.
