## Ganska Portfolio
This is the public portfolio of my work for Telling Stories with Data during the Summer 2020 term.

### About Me
My name is Mary Ganska, my pronouns are she/hers, and I am a part-time MPM student graduating in May 2021. I work at Carnegie Mellon University in the Office of International Education. I have always appreciated how clear and clean data can convey information so well, and I'm excited to work with programs I haven't used to better share data. 

I also enjoy photography and this past fall, I started a website <a href="https://www.maryganska.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to share some of my work. I am always planning my next trip out of the country and I love to scuba dive. I was certified last year and can't wait to travel somewhere warm again to dive, since staying at home means cold quarry diving.

### What I Hope to Learn...
I am interested in how to leverage the data from my office to better communicate with our campus partners. I hope that skills I learn in this course can be applied immediately to some projects I'd like to accomplish. Our office is one that links to so many others on campus, and we have a high volume of work. Using data visualizations to communicate our needs to campus stakeholders could be one way to take things learned in this course and apply them quickly. 

Once I graduate, I hope to either stay within CMU and find a position where I can use the skills I've learned more fully, or I would like to move into the non-profit realm. No matter where I land, I want to stay connected and passionate about whatever work I am doing.
